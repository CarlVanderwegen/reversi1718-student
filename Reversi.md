# Reversi

Reversi is a two player board game where both players attempt to fill the board with as many of their own stones. The game ends when the board is full. The winner is the player with the most stones on the board.

The players are named Black and White. The original board state is (assuming a 8 &times; 8 board):

```raw
........
........
........
...WB...
...BW...
........
........
........
```

Black and White alternatingly place a stone of their color on the board. While doing so, enemy stones can be captured. Consider the following board:

```raw
........       ........
........       ........
........       ........
.*BBBBW.  -->  .WWWWWW.
........       ........
........       ........
........       ........
........       ........
```

White puts his stone at the position indicated by `*`. All black stones surrounded by this new stone and another white stone are captured: they are replaced by white stones. Capturing happens in all eight directions.

Players are only allowed to place a stone on positions that causes at least one enemy stone to be captured. For example, valid positions for Black are indicated by `*`:

```raw
........
........
...*....
..*WB...
...BW*..
....*...
........
........
```

If a player has no valid moves left, he loses his turn. The game goes on until the board is full.
